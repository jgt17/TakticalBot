A Tak AI implementation, using CNN
Joseph Tate

To play, run TakticalAI.py

To train, run TakNet_train.py
Copy the checkpoint, events..., graph.pptxt, and model.ckpt-* files you want to use into the Network folder

To create the files to train from:
run ParseGameStates.py on RawDatabase/FilteredGames, then
run GeneratePermutations.py, then
run TakNet_input.py

Model Name Schema:


This implementation uses
(mostly compliant) Portable Tak Notation (PTN)

and Tak Positional System (TPS)

The raw dataset is from www.playtak.com/games

TensorFlow was used extensively for the CNN portion, www.tensorflow.org
